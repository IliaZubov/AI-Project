  "content": "This guideline defines the principles and procedures governing underwriting risk assessment and premium pricing at NordSure Insurance. The objective is to ensure that underwriting decisions are consistent, data-driven, and aligned with the company’s risk appetite and regulatory obligations.\n\nUnderwriting assessments must be based on verified customer information, historical loss data, actuarial models, and approved risk factors. Underwriters shall not apply subjective judgment that contradicts documented pricing rules without proper justification and approval.\n\nAutomated underwriting systems may be used to calculate baseline premiums and coverage limits. Any manual adjustment exceeding predefined thresholds must be documented, including rationale, supporting evidence, and approving authority. Manual overrides require secondary approval from a senior underwriter.\n\nHigh-risk applicants must be assessed using enhanced due diligence procedures. These include additional data verification, loss history analysis, and, where applicable, external risk data sources. Decisions to decline coverage must reference objective criteria and documented risk indicators.\n\nPricing models must be reviewed annually by the Actuarial Function. Changes to rating factors or weightings require approval from Risk Management and Compliance prior to implementation. Historical pricing decisions must remain auditable for a minimum of ten years.\n\nFailure to adhere to underwriting guidelines may expose NordSure to adverse selection, regulatory sanctions, and financial loss. Management is responsible for ensuring that underwriting staff receive regular training and that underwriting tools remain compliant with regulatory standards.",
