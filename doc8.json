  "content": "This policy governs the use of artificial intelligence and automated decision-making systems at NordSure Insurance.\n\nAI systems may be used to support underwriting, claims triage, fraud detection, and customer service. AI must not fully replace human judgment in decisions that materially affect customers.\n\nAll AI models must be documented, tested for bias, and approved prior to deployment. Explainability is mandatory for customer-facing decisions.\n\nAI performance must be monitored continuously. Significant model changes require re-approval.\n\nNon-compliance may result in system suspension and disciplinary action.",
