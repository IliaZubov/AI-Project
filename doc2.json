  "content": "NordSure Insurance is committed to preventing, detecting, and responding to insurance fraud across all product lines. Fraud undermines trust, increases premiums, and exposes the company to regulatory risk.\n\nAll claims, applications, and policy changes must undergo automated fraud screening. Indicators include inconsistent statements, abnormal claim frequency, document alteration, and data mismatches across internal and external sources. High-risk cases shall be flagged for manual review.\n\nFraud investigations must be conducted objectively and confidentially. Employees must not accuse customers directly or imply criminal behavior prior to completion of a formal investigation. Investigators are required to document findings, evidence sources, and conclusions.\n\nConfirmed fraud cases must be reported to relevant authorities where legally required. Internal reporting to Compliance and Risk Management is mandatory within five business days of confirmation.\n\nUse of AI tools in fraud detection must comply with data protection laws and internal ethical AI guidelines. Automated decisions affecting customers must remain explainable and subject to human oversight.\n\nEmployees who knowingly facilitate or ignore fraudulent activity may face disciplinary measures including termination. Annual fraud awareness training is mandatory for all claims and underwriting staff.",
