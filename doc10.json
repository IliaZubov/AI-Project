  "content": "This policy defines the framework for internal audit, ongoing monitoring, and regulatory reporting at NordSure Insurance. The objective is to ensure compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and internal policies, while supporting effective risk management and governance.\n\nThe Internal Audit function operates independently from operational management and reports directly to the Audit Committee of the Board. Audit activities shall be conducted in accordance with recognized professional standards and based on a risk-based audit plan approved annually.\n\nAudits may include reviews of underwriting, claims handling, data protection, financial controls, outsourcing arrangements, and the use of automated or AI-supported systems. Audit scope and methodology must be documented, and findings shall be supported by sufficient and reliable evidence.\n\nManagement is responsible for addressing audit findings within agreed timelines. Corrective actions must be documented, assigned to accountable owners, and monitored until completion. Unresolved high-risk findings shall be escalated to senior management and the Board.\n\nOngoing monitoring activities complement formal audits and include key risk indicators, compliance testing, and control self-assessments. Results of monitoring activities must be reported periodically to Risk Management and Compliance.\n\nRegulatory reporting obligations must be fulfilled accurately and within prescribed deadlines. Reports submitted to supervisory authorities must be complete, consistent, and based on verified data. Any material errors or omissions must be disclosed promptly.\n\nSpecial attention must be given to regulatory reporting related to data protection, financial solvency, and the use of automated decision-making systems. Documentation supporting regulatory submissions must be retained for a minimum of ten years.\n\nFailure to comply with this policy may result in regulatory sanctions, reputational damage, and internal disciplinary action.",
